# How to use

Our Material Kit React Native app and components are easy to use in order to configure it on your own and get it ready for production. 

Make sure you have npm/yarn installed. After you've installed any of those, install expo by writing the following in your terminal console: `npm install -g expo-cli` (or `yarn global add expo-cli` , whichever you prefer). 

Now you're all set up. Navigate your way into the project's directory and write `npm install` or `yarn install`. This will install all dependencies that Material Kit React Native needs in order to function properly. 

Now write `expo start` and you're ready to go. A new window will pop-up in your default browser. This is your localhost's dashboard. Open up your favorite text editor/IDE and an Android/iOS simulator. 

You're now ready to go! You can edit our template and use our design to create your awesome mobile app!
